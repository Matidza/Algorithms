## Introduction

Algorithms and data structures are essential building blocks for solving computational problems efficiently. This project is a curated collection of implementations, covering a wide range of topics such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and fundamental data structures. Each algorithm and data structure comes with detailed explanations and examples to aid in understanding.

## Languages

The implementations in this repository are provided in various programming languages, including but not limited to:

- Python

Feel free to contribute implementations in other languages!

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific category. Here are some of the main categories:

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, QuickSort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Examples of searching algorithms such as Binary Search, Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Algorithms related to graph theory, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Solutions to problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of fundamental data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables, and more.
- **Miscellaneous:** Other algorithms and data structures.

## Usage

Each algorithm and data structure is contained in its own folder with a dedicated README file providing explanations, time complexity analysis, and usage examples. To explore a specific implementation, navigate to its respective folder and follow the instructions in the README.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new algorithm or data structure, improve an existing implementation, or suggest enhancements, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.
