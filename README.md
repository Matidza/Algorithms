- Python
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript

Feel free to contribute implementations in other languages!

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific category of algorithms. Here are some of the main categories:

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, QuickSort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Examples of searching algorithms such as Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Algorithms related to graph theory, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Solutions to problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Miscellaneous:** Other algorithms and data structures.

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own folder with a dedicated README file providing explanations, time complexity analysis, and usage examples. To explore a specific algorithm, navigate to its respective folder and follow the instructions in the README.
